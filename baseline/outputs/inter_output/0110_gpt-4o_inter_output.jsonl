Optionally, rename the new column to match the old column name for consistency.\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE team_attributes RENAME COLUMN buildupplayspeedclass_id TO buildupplayspeedclass;\n```\n\nBy using a lookup table, you can easily add new values without altering the table structure, thus avoiding downtime.

Here's an example of how you might correct the query to get a list of distinct artists:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT artist FROM cards;\n```\n\nIf you want to get more information about each artist, such as the number of cards they have, you can use an aggregate function like `COUNT`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist;\n```\n\nThese queries will give you a distinct result for each artist or a summary of the number of cards per artist, respectively."}

Here's how you can correct your SQL:\n\n1. Use `position` to find the index of the first occurrence of a character.\n2. Use `substring` to extract a portion of the string.\n\nHere's the corrected SQL for your trigger function:\n\n```sql\nBEGIN\n    INSERT INTO profiles (Id, CreationDate, WebsiteUrl)\n    SELECT new.Id, new.CreationDate, \n           substring(new.WebsiteUrl from 'http://([^\\.]+)') as WebsiteUrl;\n    RETURN new;\nEND;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `substring` function with a regular expression is used to extract the part of the URL between 'http://' and the first '.'.\n- The regular expression `'http://([^\\.]+)'` captures the desired part of the URL."}

Here are some steps and considerations to improve the query performance:\n\n1. **Indexing**: Ensure that the necessary indexes are in place. For your query, you should have indexes on the columns used in the `WHERE` clause and the `JOIN` condition. Specifically, consider the following indexes:\n   - An index on `trans(account_id, bank, type)`.\n   - An index on `account(account_id, district_id)`.\n\n2. **Query Optimization**: The query itself seems logically correct, but we can ensure that it is written in a way that encourages the use of indexes.\n\n3. **Statistics and Maintenance**: Make sure that the database statistics are up-to-date. You can run `ANALYZE` on the tables to update the statistics.\n\n4. **Configuration**: Check the database configuration settings, such as `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, and `effective_cache_size`, to ensure they are optimized for your workload.\n\n5. **Execution Plan Analysis**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand the execution plan chosen by the planner and identify any bottlenecks.\n\nHere's the SQL query with the suggested improvements:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.trans_id, \n       t.account_id, \n       t.date, \n       t.type, \n       t.amount  \nFROM trans t  \nJOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id \nWHERE a.district_id = 18 \n  AND t.bank = 'AB' \n  AND t.type IN ('PRIJEM', 'VYDAJ');\n```\n\nTo further improve performance, ensure the following:\n\n- **Index Creation**: If not already done, create the suggested indexes:\n  ```sql\n  CREATE INDEX idx_trans_account_bank_type ON trans(account_id, bank, type);\n  CREATE INDEX idx_account_district ON account(account_id, district_id);\n  ```\n\n- **Analyze Tables**: Update statistics for better query planning:\n  ```sql\n  ANALYZE trans;\n  ANALYZE account;\n  ```\n\n- **Check Execution Plan**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see if the indexes are being used effectively:\n  ```sql\n  EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n  SELECT t.trans_id, \n         t.account_id, \n         t.date, \n         t.type, \n         t.amount  \n  FROM trans t  \n  JOIN account a ON"}

If either or both are present, it counts them as one."}

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```sql\nWITH existing_loan AS (\n    SELECT loan_id\n    FROM loan\n    WHERE account_id = 2 AND date = '1996-04-29'\n)\nUPDATE loan\nSET amount = amount + 1000\nWHERE loan_id = (SELECT loan_id FROM existing_loan)\nRETURNING *;\n\nINSERT INTO loan (account_id, date, amount, duration, payments, status)\nSELECT 2, '1996-04-29', 30276, 12, 2523.0, 'B'\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM existing_loan);\n```\n\nThis SQL first checks if a loan record exists for the given `account_id` and `date`. If it exists, it updates the `amount`. If it does not exist, it inserts a new record. The `loan_id` is not specified in the `INSERT` statement, so it will automatically use the next value from the sequence."}

It retrieves the previous non-null value within the same partition.\n\n4. **Row Number Handling**: The subquery assigns a row number to each row, which is used to match rows in the update statement.\n\n5. **Null Check**: The update is applied only to rows where the column value is `NULL`.\n\nThis function should now correctly apply a forward fill to all nullable columns in any specified table, partitioned by the given ID column and ordered by the row number column."}

The `jsonb_set` function is not being used correctly. It requires a path to the specific element to update, but the path provided is not correct.\n2. The subquery is not correctly extracting the position of the element with `id` 101.\n3. The subtraction operation `(configurations->'id') - ...` is incorrect because `configurations->'id'` does not return a numeric value that can be directly used in arithmetic operations.\n\nTo correct the SQL, we need to:\n- Use `jsonb_array_elements` to iterate over the JSON array and find the correct index of the object with `id` 101.\n- Use the correct path in `jsonb_set` to update the `settings` field of the specific object.\n\nHere's the corrected SQL:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE teams_config\nSET configurations = (\n    SELECT jsonb_agg(\n        CASE\n            WHEN elem->>'id' = '101' THEN\n                jsonb_set(elem, '{settings}', '\"newSettingValue\"')\n            ELSE\n                elem\n        END\n    )\n    FROM jsonb_array_elements(configurations) WITH ORDINALITY arr(elem, position)\n)\nWHERE EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM jsonb_array_elements(configurations) elem\n    WHERE elem->>'id' = '101'\n);\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We use `jsonb_array_elements` to iterate over each element in the `configurations` JSON array.\n- We use a `CASE` statement to check if the `id` of the current element is `101`. If it is, we update the `settings` field using `jsonb_set`.\n- We use `jsonb_agg` to aggregate the modified elements back into a JSON array.\n- The `WHERE EXISTS` clause ensures that we only update rows where an element with `id` 101 exists."}

Are there any caveats with capturing multiple matches from the same row in PostgreSQL?", "error_sql": ["SELECT\n    id,\n    text,\n    REGEXP_MATCHES(\n        text,\n        '\\{.*?\\}',\n        'g'\n    ) AS bracketed_tokens\nFROM cards;"], "sol_sql": ["SELECT\n    c.id,\n    c.text,\n    (\n        SELECT array_agg(matches[1])\n        FROM regexp_matches(\n            c.text,\n            '(\\{[^{}]*\\})',\n            'g'\n        ) AS matches\n    ) AS bracketed_tokens\nFROM cards AS c;"], "preprocess_sql": [""], "clean_up_sql": [""], "test_cases": ["def test_case(pred_sqls, sol_sqls, db_name, conn):\n    pred_query_result = execute_queries(pred_sqls,db_name,conn)\n    sol_query_result = execute_queries(sol_sqls,db_name,conn)\n    result = pred_query_result == sol_query_result\n    assert result, f\"ex returned {result} but expected True.\"\n    return result"], "response": "To achieve the desired result, you can use the `regexp_matches` function in PostgreSQL, which allows you to extract all matches of a regular expression from a string. However, `regexp_matches` returns a set of text arrays, so you need to use it in a way that handles multiple matches per row. You can use a lateral join to achieve this. Here's how you can structure your query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    c.id,\n    c.text,\n    array_agg(matched_tokens) AS bracketed_tokens,\n    count(matched_tokens) AS token_count\nFROM\n    cards c\nLEFT JOIN LATERAL\n    regexp_matches(c.text, '\\{\\{.*?\\}\\}', 'g') AS matched_tokens\nON true\nGROUP BY c.id, c.text;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`regexp_matches` with LATERAL JOIN**: The `regexp_matches` function is used with a pattern `\\{\\{.*?\\}\\}` to match all occurrences of text within double curly braces. The 'g' flag is used to find all matches in the text.\n\n2. **LATERAL JOIN**: This allows you to apply the `regexp_matches` function to each row of the `cards` table, returning a set of matches for each row.\n\n3. **`array_agg`**: This aggregates all matched tokens into an array for each row, allowing you to see all tokens found in the `text` column.\n\n4. **`count`**: This counts the number of tokens found per row.\n\n5. **`LEFT JOIN`**: Ensures that even if no matches are found, the row is still returned with `NULL` for `bracketed_tokens` and `0` for `token_count`.\n\nThis query will return each card's ID, the original text, an array of all bracketed tokens found, and the count of these tokens."}

Then, count the customers who made purchases in months after their first purchase.\n\nHere's the corrected SQL:\n\n```sql\nWITH first_purchase AS (\n    SELECT customer_id, MIN(month_year) AS first_month_year\n    FROM orders\n    GROUP BY customer_id\n)\nSELECT o.month_year, COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) AS repeat_customers\nFROM orders o\nJOIN first_purchase fp ON o.customer_id = fp.customer_id\nWHERE o.month_year > fp.first_month_year\nGROUP BY o.month_year\nORDER BY o.month_year;\n```\n\nThis query uses a common table expression (CTE) to first find the earliest purchase month for each customer. It then joins this result with the `orders` table to find purchases made in months after the first purchase month, counting these as repeat purchases."}

Specifically, we want to create a table that lists each player, the date they joined a team, and the date they left the team. This will allow us to easily query the data to determine if a player was part of a team on a specific date.

Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```sql\nWITH deleted_rows AS (\n    DELETE FROM superhero WHERE id = 999 RETURNING 1\n)\nSELECT COALESCE((SELECT 1 FROM deleted_rows), 0) AS result;\n```\n\nIn this corrected SQL:\n- The `WITH` clause is used to perform the `DELETE` operation and capture any rows that are deleted.\n- The `SELECT` statement then checks if any rows were returned from the `deleted_rows` CTE.\n- If no rows were deleted, the `COALESCE` function returns `0` as the default value. If rows were deleted, it returns `1`."}

The use of window functions `MIN` and `MAX` with `OVER (PARTITION BY hero_id)` will not correctly identify continuous spans because it doesn't consider the continuity condition (i.e., the end time of one mission is the start time of the next mission).\n\nTo solve this, we need to implement a logic that groups continuous missions together. This can be achieved by using a technique that involves identifying gaps between missions and then grouping them accordingly. Here's a corrected version of the SQL:\n\n```sql\nWITH mission_spans AS (\n    SELECT \n        hero_id, \n        mission_start, \n        mission_end,\n        CASE \n            WHEN LAG(mission_end) OVER (PARTITION BY hero_id ORDER BY mission_start) = mission_start THEN 0\n            ELSE 1\n        END AS new_group\n    FROM \n        superhero_missions\n),\ngrouped_missions AS (\n    SELECT \n        hero_id, \n        mission_start, \n        mission_end,\n        SUM(new_group) OVER (PARTITION BY hero_id ORDER BY mission_start) AS group_id\n    FROM \n        mission_spans\n)\nSELECT \n    hero_id, \n    MIN(mission_start) AS earliest_start, \n    MAX(mission_end) AS latest_end\nFROM \n    grouped_missions\nGROUP BY \n    hero_id, group_id\nORDER BY \n    hero_id, earliest_start;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **mission_spans CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates a `new_group` flag that indicates whether a new group of continuous missions should start. It uses the `LAG` function to check if the `mission_start` of the current row is equal to the `mission_end` of the previous row for the same `hero_id`.\n\n2. **grouped_missions CTE**: This CTE calculates a `group_id` by summing up the `new_group` flags. This effectively assigns a unique group identifier to each set of continuous missions.\n\n3. **Final SELECT**: The final query groups by `hero_id` and `group_id` to find the earliest start and latest end times for each group of continuous missions."}
