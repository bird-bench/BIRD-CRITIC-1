We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I have two tables, transactions_1k and customers. I want to join transactions_1k with customers based on the value of the field `CustomerID` in transactions_1k. This is my current query: 

```sql
SELECT transactions_1k.* FROM transactions_1k LEFT JOIN customers ON transactions_1k.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID LIMIT 5;```

 The query works though I'm not seeing any customer information attached to the transactions. Am I missing something here? Thanks.
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
