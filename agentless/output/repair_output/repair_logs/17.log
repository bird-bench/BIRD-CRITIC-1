--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I'm trying to write a full-text search with the following SQL syntax:```sql
SELECT s.member_id FROM member s WHERE s.position='Member' AND MATCH (s.email) AGAINST ('angela.sanders@lpu.edu' IN BOOLEAN MODE);``` I got the error: ```error
(1064, "syntax error, unexpected '@', expecting $end")``` How can I fix this?
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
