We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I want to merge two tables and subtract the number of records in resulting table from left join from the resulting table in inner join. This is what I have done but I do not know if this is correct or how to proceed? What I have done:
```sqlWITH t1 AS ( SELECT e.event_id FROM event e LEFT JOIN attendance a ON e.event_id = a.link_to_event ), t2 AS ( SELECT e.event_id FROM event e INNEr JOIN attendance a ON e.event_id = a.link_to_event)
```
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
