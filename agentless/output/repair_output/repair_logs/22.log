We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I have a MySQL table named transactions_1k, from where I would like to retrieve top 3 data within a date range in decreasing order by amount. I write the SQL query as provided, ```sql

SELECT * 
FROM transactions_1k
WHERE CONCAT(Date, ' ', TIME(Time)) 
      BETWEEN Date('2012-08-22') AND Date('2012-08-23')
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
 I have records in '2012-08-23', but the query returns an empty set. What am I doing wrong here? Thanks.
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
