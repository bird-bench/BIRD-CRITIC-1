We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I have two tables users and badges, where badges contains information about badges earned by users and users contains information about users. I would like to create a list of all the users linked to a badge data with or without the badge data (some users may not have any badges). I was thinking about using a UNION and it gets me close to where i wanna be, but not quiet yet :). The sql is ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.Id AS UserId,
    u.DisplayName,
    u.Reputation,
    b.Name AS BadgeName,
    b.Date AS BadgeDate
FROM
    users u
LEFT JOIN badges b ON b.UserId = u.Id
WHERE 
    u.Reputation >= 10000
    AND b.Name = 'Teacher'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT
    u.Id AS UserId,
    u.DisplayName,
    u.Reputation,
    NULL AS BadgeName,
    NULL AS BadgeDate
FROM
    users u
LEFT JOIN badges b ON b.UserId = u.Id
WHERE 
    u.Reputation >= 10000;
```What happens with this query is that it creates double records for users that have a badge. I would like to have one record per user, with or without a badge. How can i change my query so that the double records will not be shown?

Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
