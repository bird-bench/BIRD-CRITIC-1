We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
my query is

```sql
INSERT INTO `superhero_event` (`superhero_id`) VALUES (256)
```
and the table structure is

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `superhero_event` (
  `event_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `superhero_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`event_id`)
);
```
COMMIT;

Now I dont understand what is the issue here also my phpmyadmin show only error code it doesnt give me the error expatiation. Any one can help me with this.
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
