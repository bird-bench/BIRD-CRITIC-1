We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I want to count the occurrences of `CDSCode` in the `schools` table, filtered by `District = 'Alameda County Office of Education'`. My original query was:
```sql
SELECT CDSCode, COUNT(CDSCODE) FROM schools WHERE District = 'Alameda County Office of Education' LIMIT 1;
```
However, I encountered an issue.```error
1140, "In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'california_schools.schools.CDSCode'; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by"```
 How can I fix it?
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
