We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I am trying to retrieve outputs with multiple 'and' statements. My code works fine until I add a particular 'and' statement.
This is the code that I am using
```sql
SELECT event.event_id, COUNT(attendance.link_to_member) AS total_attendance, GROUP_CONCAT(member.member_id) AS member_ids
FROM event
JOIN attendance ON event.event_id = attendance.link_to_event
JOIN member ON attendance.link_to_member = member.member_id
WHERE event.status LIKE '%Open%' AND
  event.status LIKE '%Closed%'
GROUP BY event.event_id
ORDER BY event.event_id;
```
Executing the SQL statement returns nothing, but I expected a return. What's the issue?
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
