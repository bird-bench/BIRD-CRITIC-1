--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I am trying to count bonds by their bond types. My query is
```sql
SELECT COUNT(b.bond_id) AS total,
       b1.bond AS bond,
       b2.bond_type_dash AS bond_type_dash,
       b3.bond_type_equal AS bond_type_equal,
       b4.bond_type_hash AS bond_type_hash
FROM bond b
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_1_2'
) AS b1 ON b1.bond_id = b.bond_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond_type_dash
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_type = '-'
) AS b2 ON b2.bond_id = b.bond_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond_type_equal
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_type = '='
) AS b3 ON b3.bond_id = b.bond_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond_type_hash
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_type = '#'
) AS b4 ON b4.bond_id = b.bond_id;
``` but it gives me error
```error
1140, "In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'toxicology.bond.bond_id'; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by"```
. How can I fix it?

Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
