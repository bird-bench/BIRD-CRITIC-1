We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
How can I use the LAG function with a WHERE clause to filter rows based on a calculated column?

Error SQL: SELECT Count, (Count - LAG(Count, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Id)) AS dif FROM backup_colour WHERE dif = 0;
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
