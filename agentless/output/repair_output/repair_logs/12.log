We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I want to update my rank column by sorting order according to the fastestLap column in ascending order and dob column in ascending order. This is my current query: 

```sql
SELECT 
    r.*, 
    @rank := @rank + 1 AS ranking
FROM 
    (SELECT @rank := 0) AS init, 
    results AS r
JOIN 
    drivers AS d ON r.driverId = d.driverId
ORDER BY 
    r.fastestLap ASC, 
    d.dob ASC
LIMIT 10;```
 But the rank column is not updated according to the sorting order. What am I doing wrong here? Thanks.
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
