We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I want to compute aggregated values for loans grouped by their `status`. Specifically, I need to calculate the total `amount`, total `payments`, and their sum for each `status`. Initially, I wrote the following query:
```sql
SELECT status, SUM(amount) AS total_amount, SUM(payments) AS total_payments, (total_amount+total_payments) AS s FROM loan GROUP BY status;
```
Error```sql
error1054, "Unknown column 'total_amount' in 'field list'"```
How can I fix this?
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
