We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I have a complex SQL query that returns the ids of cards that are not current card with id 1 and not related with cucrrent card. The relationship between cards is stored in decks and the column status shows cards relations.SQL
```sql
SELECT id FROM cards JOIN decks ON cards.id = decks.card1_id WHERE decks.card1_id != 1```
How can I get expected results?
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
