We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I have a table Player_Attributes for each player, with 5 attributes: crossing  finishing  heading_accuracy  short_passing  volleys. Each attribute is a score from 0-100. Now I want to retrieve the top 3 attributes for each player to build two new columns with the top 3 scores and their attributes (Scores or attributes should be contatenated using a comma, and no space). My current sql is ```sql

SELECT 
    id, 
    MAX(Max_v) AS Max_v,
    NULL AS MAX_attribute
FROM (
    SELECT id, crossing AS Max_v, 'crossing' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, finishing AS Max_v, 'finishing' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, heading_accuracy AS Max_v, 'heading_accuracy' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, short_passing AS Max_v, 'short_passing' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, volleys AS Max_v, 'volleys' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
) T 
GROUP BY id LIMIT 10;```
 But, this query is not giving me the top 3 scores and attributes for each player. What I'm trying to do is get the maximum 1(Highest), Maximum 2 (Second Highest) and the Maximum 3 (Third Highest) score across the 5 attributes along with the attribute name of the column where the 1,2,3 maximum score was found or belong to.
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
