We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I'm encountering an issue with a SQL query where the totals calculated using SUM are incorrect.
 I am trying to calculate the sum of expense.cost and budget.amount, grouped by link_to_event.
```sql
SELECT SUM(expense.cost) AS total_expense, SUM(budget.amount) AS total_budget, budget.link_to_event FROM budget, expense WHERE budget.budget_id = expense.link_to_budget GROUP BY budget.link_to_event;``` When I run this query, I notice that SUM(budget.amount) returns values much larger than expected.
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
