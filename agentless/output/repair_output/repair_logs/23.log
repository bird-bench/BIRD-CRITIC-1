We are currently solving the following issue within the user query. Here is the user query:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I want to find all drivers associated with a specific race (raceId=19). However, when I used the following query, the results included data from other races as well:
```sql
SELECT s.driverStandingsId, s.raceId, d.driverId FROM driverStandings s LEFT JOIN drivers d on d.driverId = s.driverId AND s.raceId= 19;
```
How can I fix this?
--- END ISSUE ---


Please generate the solution SQL query to fix the issue.
If there are multiple steps to solve the issue, please provide all the steps and separate them with a semicolon (;).

Wrap the solution SQL query with ```sql...```
