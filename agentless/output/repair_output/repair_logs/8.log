--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I am trying to count the maximum overlap count of datetime ranges. My query is
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM
    duration AS d
WHERE
    ('2011-12-19 12:00:00' >= d.start AND '2011-12-19 12:00:00' < d.end) OR
    ('2011-12-19 15:00:00' > d.start AND '2011-12-19 15:00:00' <= d.end) OR
    (d.start BETWEEN '2011-12-19 12:00:00' AND '2011-12-19 15:00:00' AND d.end BETWEEN '2011-12-19 12:00:00' AND '2011-12-19 15:00:00');
``` but it gives me incorrect overlap count. How can I fix it?
