We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I want to update the `name` field in the `League` table by prepending 'abc,' to the `name` where `country_id > 1000`. Initially, I wrote the following query:
```sql
UPDATE l SET name = concat('abc', ',', name) FROM League l INNER JOIN Country c ON l.country_id = c.id GROUP BY l.country_id HAVING l.country_id > 1000;
```
Error:
```sql
error1064, "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'FROM League l
INNER JOIN Country c ON l.country_id = c.id
GROUP BY l.country_id ' at line 2"```How can I fix this?
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.
