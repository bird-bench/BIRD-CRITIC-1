We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I have two tables users and badges, where badges contains information about badges earned by users and users contains information about users. I would like to create a list of all the users linked to a badge data with or without the badge data (some users may not have any badges). I was thinking about using a UNION and it gets me close to where i wanna be, but not quiet yet :). The sql is ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    u.Id AS UserId,
    u.DisplayName,
    u.Reputation,
    b.Name AS BadgeName,
    b.Date AS BadgeDate
FROM
    users u
LEFT JOIN badges b ON b.UserId = u.Id
WHERE 
    u.Reputation >= 10000
    AND b.Name = 'Teacher'

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT
    u.Id AS UserId,
    u.DisplayName,
    u.Reputation,
    NULL AS BadgeName,
    NULL AS BadgeDate
FROM
    users u
LEFT JOIN badges b ON b.UserId = u.Id
WHERE 
    u.Reputation >= 10000;
```What happens with this query is that it creates double records for users that have a badge. I would like to have one record per user, with or without a badge. How can i change my query so that the double records will not be shown?
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.

The function attempts to execute the provided SQL query on the database.\n\n2. **Print "Issue reproduced"**: If an exception is raised during the execution of the query, the function prints "Issue reproduced". This indicates that the issue is present, likely due to a database error or incorrect query.\n\n3. **Print "Issue resolved"**: If the query executes successfully, the function checks if the result contains duplicate `UserId` values. If duplicates are found, it prints "Issue reproduced". If no duplicates are found, it prints "Issue resolved", indicating that the issue has been fixed.\n\n4. **Test Function Name and Parameters**: The function is named `test_issue` and takes two parameters: `sql` and `db`.\n\n### Usage:\nTo use this test, you would need to replace `perform_query_on_mysql_databases` with the actual function or method you use to execute SQL queries on your MySQL database.
