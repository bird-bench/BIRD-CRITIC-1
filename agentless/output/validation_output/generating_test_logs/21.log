We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I have a table Player_Attributes for each player, with 5 attributes: crossing  finishing  heading_accuracy  short_passing  volleys. Each attribute is a score from 0-100. Now I want to retrieve the top 3 attributes for each player to build two new columns with the top 3 scores and their attributes (Scores or attributes should be contatenated using a comma, and no space). My current sql is ```sql

SELECT 
    id, 
    MAX(Max_v) AS Max_v,
    NULL AS MAX_attribute
FROM (
    SELECT id, crossing AS Max_v, 'crossing' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, finishing AS Max_v, 'finishing' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, heading_accuracy AS Max_v, 'heading_accuracy' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, short_passing AS Max_v, 'short_passing' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, volleys AS Max_v, 'volleys' AS AttributeName FROM Player_Attributes
) T 
GROUP BY id LIMIT 10;```
 But, this query is not giving me the top 3 scores and attributes for each player. What I'm trying to do is get the maximum 1(Highest), Maximum 2 (Second Highest) and the Maximum 3 (Third Highest) score across the 5 attributes along with the attribute name of the column where the 1,2,3 maximum score was found or belong to.
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.
