We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
 I have two tables, transactions_1k and customers. I want to join transactions_1k with customers based on the value of the field `CustomerID` in transactions_1k. This is my current query: 

```sql
SELECT transactions_1k.* FROM transactions_1k LEFT JOIN customers ON transactions_1k.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID LIMIT 5;```

 The query works though I'm not seeing any customer information attached to the transactions. Am I missing something here? Thanks.
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.

It does this by asserting that each row in the result has more than one column (indicating that it includes data from both tables) and that the row contains a column named `CustomerName` (indicating that customer information is present).\n4. **Resolving the Issue**: If the assertions pass, the test prints "Issue resolved".
