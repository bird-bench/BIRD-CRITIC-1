We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I'm encountering an issue with a SQL query where the totals calculated using SUM are incorrect.
 I am trying to calculate the sum of expense.cost and budget.amount, grouped by link_to_event.
```sql
SELECT SUM(expense.cost) AS total_expense, SUM(budget.amount) AS total_budget, budget.link_to_event FROM budget, expense WHERE budget.budget_id = expense.link_to_budget GROUP BY budget.link_to_event;``` When I run this query, I notice that SUM(budget.amount) returns values much larger than expected.
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.

This threshold should be adjusted based on the actual expected values in your database.\n\n### Usage:\nTo use this test, you would need to pass the SQL query from the issue text and the appropriate database connection or configuration to the `test_issue` function.
