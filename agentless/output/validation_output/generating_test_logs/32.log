We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I have a complex SQL query that returns the ids of cards that are not current card with id 1 and not related with cucrrent card. The relationship between cards is stored in decks and the column status shows cards relations.SQL
```sql
SELECT id FROM cards JOIN decks ON cards.id = decks.card1_id WHERE decks.card1_id != 1```
How can I get expected results?
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.

For simplicity, the expected result is hardcoded as `[2, 3, 4]`. In a real-world scenario, this expected result should be derived from the actual data in the database.\n\n### Usage:\nTo use this test, you would need to provide the SQL query and the database connection/configuration as arguments to the `test_issue` function.
