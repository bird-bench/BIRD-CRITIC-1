We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I need to retrieve one record per code_id based on the following logic:
If a row with code_status_id = 3 exists for a code_id, retrieve it.
Otherwise, retrieve the row with the largest release_id for code_status_id = 2.
I attempted the following query but was unable to achieve the desired result
```sql
SELECT c1.release_id, c1.code_id, c1.code_status_id, c1.code_created_date FROM card_release c1 LEFT JOIN card_release c2 ON c1.code_id = c2.code_id AND c1.release_id < c2.release_id WHERE ISNULL(c2.release_id);```
How can I modify this query to implement the required prioritization logic?
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.
