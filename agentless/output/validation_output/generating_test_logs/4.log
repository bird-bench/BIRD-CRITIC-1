We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I want to filter bond IDs that start with TR1, TR2, or TR3 and end with 4 or 5 using MySQL. My original query was:
```sql
SELECT bond_id FROM bond WHERE bond_id LIKE 'TR1%5' OR bond_id LIKE 'TR2%4';
```
However, this query did not cover all expected patterns efficiently. How can I fix it?
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.
