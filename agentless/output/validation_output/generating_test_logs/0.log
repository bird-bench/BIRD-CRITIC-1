We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I am trying to count bonds by their bond types. My query is
```sql
SELECT COUNT(b.bond_id) AS total,
       b1.bond AS bond,
       b2.bond_type_dash AS bond_type_dash,
       b3.bond_type_equal AS bond_type_equal,
       b4.bond_type_hash AS bond_type_hash
FROM bond b
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_1_2'
) AS b1 ON b1.bond_id = b.bond_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond_type_dash
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_type = '-'
) AS b2 ON b2.bond_id = b.bond_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond_type_equal
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_type = '='
) AS b3 ON b3.bond_id = b.bond_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT bond_id, COUNT(*) AS bond_type_hash
    FROM bond
    WHERE bond_type = '#'
) AS b4 ON b4.bond_id = b.bond_id;
``` but it gives me error
```error
1140, "In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression #1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column 'toxicology.bond.bond_id'; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by"```
. How can I fix it?
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.
