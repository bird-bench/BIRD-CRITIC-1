We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
I want to retrieve the first record from the transaction table, ordered by trans_id, along with associated district_id from the account table. Initially, I wrote the following query:
```sql
SELECT t.trans_id, a.district_id, t.amount FROM trans t JOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id;```
However, I only need 1 record. How can I fix this?
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced: either an exception is raised or the outcome is incorrect
3. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. The name of the test function must be test_issue with two parameter sql and db

Here is an example:
```python
def test_issue(sql, db) -> None:
    try:
        result, conn = perform_query_on_mysql_databases(sql, db)
    except:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    try:
        assert result[0] == ("HR",)
        assert result[1] == ("Finance",)
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.

The function attempts to execute the provided SQL query on the database using `perform_query_on_mysql_databases`.\n\n2. **Handling Exceptions**: If an exception is raised during the query execution (e.g., due to a syntax error or database connection issue), the test prints "Issue reproduced" and returns.\n\n3. **Verifying the Result**: If the query executes successfully, the test checks:\n   - Whether the result contains only one record (`len(result) == 1`).\n   - Whether the result contains the expected columns (`trans_id`, `district_id`, and `amount`).\n\n4. **Resolving the Issue**: If both checks pass, the test prints "Issue resolved". If any of the checks fail, the test prints "Issue reproduced".\n\n### Usage:\n- To reproduce the issue, you can pass the original SQL query (`SELECT t.trans_id, a.district_id, t.amount FROM trans t JOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id;`) to the `test_issue` function.\n- To verify the fix, you can pass the corrected SQL query (e.g., `SELECT t.trans_id, a.district_id, t.amount FROM trans t JOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id ORDER BY t.trans_id LIMIT 1;`) to the `test_issue` function.\n\nThis test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify that the issue has been resolved.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1733925150, model='deepseek-chat', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_1bcb2de9ac', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=592, prompt_tokens=407, total_tokens=999, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None, prompt_cache_hit_tokens=128, prompt_cache_miss_tokens=279))

This function should be implemented elsewhere in your codebase to handle the actual database connection and query execution.\n\n2. **Print "Issue reproduced"**: If an exception is raised during the query execution, it means the issue is reproduced. This could happen if the query is incorrect or if there are issues with the database connection.\n\n3. **Print "Issue resolved"**: If the query executes successfully and the result contains only one record (as expected), the issue is considered resolved. The assertion `assert len(result) == 1` ensures that only one record is returned.\n\n4. **Test function parameters**: The `test_issue` function takes two parameters: `sql` (the SQL query to be executed) and `db` (the database connection or configuration).\n\n### Usage:\n- To reproduce the issue, you would pass the original SQL query (`SELECT t.trans_id, a.district_id, t.amount FROM trans t JOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id;`) to the `sql` parameter.\n- To verify the fix, you would pass the corrected SQL query (e.g., `SELECT t.trans_id, a.district_id, t.amount FROM trans t JOIN account a ON t.account_id = a.account_id ORDER BY t.trans_id LIMIT 1;`) to the `sql` parameter.\n\n### Note:\n- The `perform_query_on_mysql_databases` function is a placeholder. You need to implement this function to handle the actual database connection and query execution.\n- The assertions can be further refined based on the expected structure and values of the result.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1733925179, model='deepseek-chat', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_1bcb2de9ac', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=627, prompt_tokens=407, total_tokens=1034, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None, prompt_cache_hit_tokens=384, prompt_cache_miss_tokens=23))
